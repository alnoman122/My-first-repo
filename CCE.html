            <h3>What is Web Development? </h3>
            <p> Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network). ... Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
                non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.

                right now, all you need is the basics of web development– a general explanation with some direction on
                where to go next.

            <h3>Roadmap to learn web development : </h3>
            <img src="image/15.07.2021_09.51.29_REC.png" class="center">
            <h3> How do websites work?
            </h3>
            <p>
                All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files that are stored on a computer called a
                server. This server is connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a browser (like
                Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your phone. Your browser is also called the client in
                this situation.

                So, every time that you’re on the internet, you (the client) are getting and loading data (like cat
                pics) from the server, as well as submitting data back to the server (load moar cat pics!) This back and
                forth between the client and the server is the basis of the internet.

                Anything that you can access in your browser is something that a web developer built. Some examples are
                small business websites and blogs on the simpler side, all the way up to very complex web apps like
                AirBnb, Facebook and Twitter.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What’s the difference between front-end and back-end?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The terms “front end,” “back end,” and “full stack” web developer describe what part of the
                client/server relationship you’re working with.

                “Front end” means that you’re dealing mainly with the client side. It’s called the “front end” because
                it’s what you can see in the browser. Conversely, the “back end” is the part of the website that you
                can’t really see, but it handles a lot of the logic and functionality that is necessary for everything
                to work.

                One way you can think about this is that front-end web development is like the “front of house” part of
                a restaurant. It’s the section where customers come to see and experience the restaurant– the interior
                decor, seating, and of course, eating the food.

                On the other hand, back-end web development is like the “back of house” part of the restaurant. It’s
                where deliveries and inventory are managed, and the process to create the food all happens. There’s a
                lot of things behind the scenes that the customers won’t see, but they will experience (and hopefully
                enjoy) the end product– a delicious meal!

                Fun illustrations aside, both front and back end web development serve different but very important
                functions.

            <h3>Basic front-end </h3>
            <p> The front-end of a website is made up of three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </p>
